# History

What was built, newest first. Append-only. Only `scribe` edits this file.

**Read this before redesigning anything.** The `Cost` line on each entry is the
point of the file — it is where the sessions that already tried the obvious
approach tell you what happened.

Do not load this file to find out whether something exists. It grows without
bound. `HISTORY-INDEX.md` carries one row per entry; scan that, then grep this
file for the exact heading it names. Every entry added here gets its index row
in the same commit.

<!--
## YYYY-MM-DD — <what landed>
<Two or three sentences: what it does now that it did not before.>
**Cost:** <what was hard, what was tried and abandoned, what not to retry.>
