# History index

One row per `## YYYY-MM-DD` entry in `HISTORY.md`, newest first. Only `scribe`
edits this file, and it writes the row in the same commit as the entry.

`HISTORY.md` grows without bound and is the single largest file a session can
accidentally load. This index exists so `planner` can answer "has this been
built before, and where do I read about it?" without opening it. Rows are taken
from `HISTORY.md`'s own headings rather than re-summarized, so the index can be
checked against its source by eye.

Read a full entry by grepping the exact string in the **Heading** column:

```
grep -n '<heading text>' docs/plan/HISTORY.md
```

Then read that section only. A stale index is worse than none — an entry with
no row is one `planner` cannot find, and will re-plan.

| Date | Task IDs | Summary | Heading (grep this exact string) |
